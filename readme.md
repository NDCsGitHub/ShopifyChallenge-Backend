I've notice shopify tech stack mainly uses Ruby, as a result I used the remaining time to start learning about ruby and made a server side  application for the challegne. The applications currently doesnt work on Replit due to issues with permission and version issues on replit. Also tried using docker, unfortunately, replit doesn't have support for docker as well.

To run this application, you have to clone, and if you have docker installed in your computer, run below command in the terminal of the root folder of the application.

docker-compose up --build
